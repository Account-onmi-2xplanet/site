## creatividade

### e se em projetos
- custo não fosse problema
- prazo não fosse problema 
- qualidade nao fosse problema 
- escopo não fosse problema 
 
### por que ou e se? foram bases de muitas ideais criativas


###  **IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE TIME TO BE CREATIVE, ASK THESE 5 QUESTIONS:**

- If I began to see my attention as a precious resource, how might I better protect it?
- How can I shift from a "manager's schedule" to a "maker's schedule"? The latter is designed with multi-hour, uninterrupted blocks.
- Am I pruning the vine? If you're juggling many projects and pastimes, cut back lesser ones to provide more time for primary ones.
- What if I trade the morning news for the "morning muse"? Morning can be a prime time for creative thinking, so march straight from the bed to the tortoise shell.
- Instead of taking breaks from social media, what if I reverse that? Spend more time disconnected and think in terms of taking breaks to social media.

*References: 1. Matthew Crawford, 2. Paul Graham, 3. Cal Newport, 4. Tom Kelley*

###  **IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE CREATIVE, STOP ASKING THESE 6 QUESTIONS:**

- Am I creative? If you're human, you are creative. There is no "creativity gene" that some have and others lack. It's a gift that is available to everyone.
- How creative am I? It's difficult to measure or answer this (besides, it's not a competition). Better to rearrange the question and ask: "How am I creative?" You will find many answers to that question.
- Where will I ever find an original idea? (Hasn't everything been thought of already?) You don't have to create from whole cloth; almost every new idea consists of fragments of existing ideas. And the fragments are everywhere.
- Where will I find the time to create? Start by turning off your iPhone (unless you use it to create).
- How can I come up with an idea that will make money? Don't begin with the outcome in mind. Find and develop a worthy idea; the money will follow (maybe).
- Where do I begin? You don't need a perfect starting point. To quote John Cage, "Begin anywhere."

*References: 1. Ann Patchett, Scott Belsky, 2. Bruce Mau, 3. Tom Kelley*

###  **TO FIND YOUR BIG IDEA, ASK THESE QUESTIONS:**

- What stirs me? To find a "problem" that's worth devoting your creative efforts to solve, start with a high interest level—meaning it touches on something that matters to you.
- What bugs me? Frustration is the starting point for many innovations and creative breakthroughs.
- What's missing? Whereas the previous question may focus on existing problems or inadequacies, this one focuses on the absence of something—a product that doesn't exist but should, a need not addressed, a perspective that is underrepresented.
- What do I keep coming back to? Pay attention to recurring themes that keep coming up in your work or even in your conversation. It may be a sign that your big idea is trying to find you.
- What is ripe for reinvention? It could be a product, but also a classic story, a theme, or a genre.

*References: 1. Bruce Mau, John Cage*

###  **BEFORE COMMITTING TO AN IDEA, ASK:**

- Can I own this problem? The best kind of problem is the one that you, alone, have noticed. But if others are pursuing it, then the question becomes: What is my special twist? What can I bring to this that others can't? This is not so much about the approach you have in mind (that's your special twist), but more about your talent, perspective, expertise—and how all of that can enable you to make a unique contribution to this creative challenge.
- Will I still love this problem tomorrow? This is a "crystal ball" question: It requires you to try to envision how well the subject, and the work itself, is apt to keep you engaged and enthused over time.
- What is the potential upside? Not to be confused with trying to predict hard outcomes (Will I make a million bucks on this idea?), but rather trying to envision the positive impact this project could have in a best-case scenario.

*References: 1. Tom Kelley*

###  **ASKING THESE "FOUR WHYS" WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND ANY PROBLEM:**

- Why does this problem matter? Use research to clarify what is at stake by digging deeper into who is affected and how. Consider the significance of that, in terms of overall effect and future ramifications.
- Why does the problem exist? Try to get to the root causes that put this problem into motion. (This may necessitate additional "whys" to get all the way down to the root.)
- Why hasn't it been solved already? This will make clear the obstacles you are up against (and may uncover past efforts that hold lessons).
- Why might that change now? What are the conditions & dynamics that might bring about a desired change?

*References: 1. Andy Warhol, Randy Komisar, Todd Henry*

###  **IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING STARTED ON A CREATIVE PROJECT, ASK:**

- Am I chasing butterflies? To move forward on a project, you must pick one butterfly (idea) and pin it down.
- Who will hold me accountable? Share your idea with someone—and schedule small deliverables.
- Am I rearranging the bookshelves? This refers to the act of "preparing to create." Make sure lessons and research aren't stall tactics.
- How can I lower the bar? Instead of trying to begin with greatness, be willing to start off with something merely okay or even bad.
- What if I begin anywhere? If you're stuck trying to think of a beginning, start in the middle, at the end, or somewhere in between.
- Can I make a prototype? Find some way to give rudimentary or early form to your idea.

*References: 1. Bruce Mau, Elizabeth Gilbert, Tim Ogilvie*

###  **USE THESE QUESTIONS TO GET HONEST, USEFUL FEEDBACK ON YOUR WORK:**

- Am I coming across? Use feedback not to change your basic idea, but just to see if it's being expressed clearly and understood.
- What do you like least about this? This question requires some courage to ask, but it's important because it gives permission to offer honest criticism. It also focuses on where the biggest problem(s) may lie.
- And what else? Also known as the "AWE" question. It is designed to extract additional criticisms and often yields deeper insights.
- What would you suggest I try? Good feedback usually tells you what's wrong or missing but may not offer a solution. Use questioning to pull that out of the feedback giver.

*References: 1. Ron Howard, Mike Birbiglia, Michael Bungay Stanier*

###  **USE THESE QUESTIONS TO KEEP YOUR CREATIVE WORK FROM GETTING STALE:**

- How can I keep moving away from what I know? To avoid becoming a "comfortable expert" in your work, follow your curiosity.
- Is it time to be a jackhammer—or a hummingbird? The first is a bulldozer, the second flits around trying many things. Both are valid approaches.
- What would it look like to do the opposite? Consider the polar opposite of your intended approach or your most ingrained assumptions.
- How can I remind myself of the wonder of discovery? Set aside time to see and experience things outside your usual frame of reference.

*References: 1. David Kelley, Jonah Lehrer, Elizabeth Gilbert*

## liderança
### não é dar a resposta certa, mas fazer a pergunta ambiciosa que ninguém está esperando

### **BEFORE TAKING ON A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE, ASK . . .**

- Why do I want to lead this endeavor?
- Why would others want me to lead them?
- Does the answer to the first question also work as an answer to the second? If not, your reasons for wanting to lead may be too self-serving.

### **TO DETERMINE IF YOU'RE READY TO BE A TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY LEADER, ASK . . .**

- Am I willing to step back in order to help others move forward? Many aspiring leaders are rising stars and high performers, but success as a leader will depend more on helping others achieve success.
- Do I have the confidence to be humble? The balance is to be humble enough to admit you don't have all the answers—while being confident that you can help the organization to figure them out.
- Can I learn to keep learning? Rising uncertainty means today's leaders cannot rely on their own expertise. They must be restless learners.
- Do I seek to create an organization in my own image? Too many leaders surround themselves with similar people, depriving the organization of the diverse thinking needed to be successful today.

### **USE THESE QUESTIONS TO "CRACK YOUR CODE" AS A LEADER**

- Who are my formative influencers? Leadership values are instilled early, often from relatives or teachers; revisit those lessons.
- When have I been at my best? Study your past successes to assess strengths and productive behaviors.
- When have I come up short—and why? Failures usually contain lessons that may be useful in developing guiding principles.
- What have I taken a stand for (and against)? This question can help clarify what matters most to you—which should shape your leadership code.
- What is my logline? Share your values by way of a story—and boil it down to a line or two that sums up what you're "about" as a leader.

### **ASK THESE "MISSION QUESTIONS" TO CLARIFY WHY YOUR COMPANY MATTERS**

- If we disappeared tomorrow, who would miss us? This speculative question helps clarify why you matter and to whom.
- What do we do that others can't or won't? This shifts the focus to an organization's strengths and uniqueness.
- What are we against? It's easy to say what you're for. It's more risky—and therefore carries more weight—for a company to oppose something.
- How might we be not just a company but a cause? Increasingly, organizations are expected to contribute something worthwhile—to employees, local communities, and the world.

### **TO SHARPEN YOUR LEADERSHIP FOCUS, ASK THESE QUESTIONS:**

- What is the one thing I can do that would make everything else easier or unnecessary? Ask this "focusing" question at the start of any new challenge or project.
- What should we stop doing? Practice "systematic abandonment."
- What do I want to go big on? Ask this instead of "What am I giving up?"
- Which stupid rule should we kill? Share this question with employees to see what they choose.
- At this moment, what is the highest, best use of my time? Use the "HBU" question to maximize personal productivity.

### **RELEASE YOUR "INNER STEVE JOBS" BY ASKING "VISIONARY" QUESTIONS**

- How can we become the company that would put us out of business? Start by envisioning a threat that doesn't exist (yet).
- How can we brace ourselves for the third wave? It's not the wave you're on now or the one you can see breaking; it's the big one yet to break.
- If an oracle could tell us about our business five years from now, what would we ask? Think of the most critical questions; then go to work on them (because you're the oracle).
- What would the seventh generation think about what we're doing? Take a lesson from the Iroquois about long-term planning.
- What is our "vision question"? Forget the vision statement. Pursue the future with an open-ended query.

### **WHEN DOING "AMBULATORY INQUIRY," A LEADER SHOULD NOT ASK . . .**

- How's it going? This is a rote question and elicits rote responses.
- Why did you? When you ask "why?" questions directly of employees, it shifts them into "justify" mode.
- Who screwed up here? Rather than focusing on a scapegoat, inquire about how best to address the issue and move forward.
- Haven't we tried this already? Often uttered by "Been there, done that" leaders. Say it enough times, and people will stop offering ideas altogether.

### **WHEN DOING "AMBULATORY INQUIRY," A LEADER SHOULD ASK . . .**

- What's the biggest challenge you're facing? You can make the "challenge" question more specific ("on this project") or more general ("in your job").
- Are you making progress? If employees feel "stuck," frustration sets in.
- Help me understand, what led to . . . Instead of asking "Why?" about a problem, start the question this way—it's wordier, but less accusatory.
- Is it clear what we're doing and why? Ask employees this question with regard to company goals, directives, policy changes, and the vision for the future.
- How can I help? Per Doug Conant, the "ultimate leadership question." But only ask it if you mean it.

### **TO ENCOURAGE A CULTURE OF INQUIRY, ASK THESE 4 QUESTIONS:**

- How can we make it safe to question? Institute a strict "no judging" rule; all questions welcome, the more the merrier.
- How might we make questioning rewarding? Celebrate productive questions by verbal recognition. To go further, offer bonuses and other tangible incentives.
- How might we make questioning productive? Train people in how to question in ways that produce results.
- How can we make a culture of inquiry stick? Make questioning a central part of meetings and other regular activities.
